Multiprocesses take care of the images while the main thread handle the screen and menu.

## To do:

  - Create the screen
  - Create User interaction -> the button and menu object | Pause the app, change the timer
  - Handle the Archillect API - > add much more info and quality
  - Add multiple paramters as screen size or other UX things
  - Apply filter on screen
  -\ Change in the process the timer w/o recreating them (sharing memory  for 1 parameter)
  -- Handle the Deezer API to adapt the refresh with the bpm of a music on a selected playlist
  - Add some new images sources -> create a little bot to dl tumblr image (need a good accuracy in image style - HARD)
